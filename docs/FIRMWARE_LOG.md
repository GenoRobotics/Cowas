# CoWaS firmware log

One entry per ROADMAP step, newest at the bottom. Each entry says what changed, which **behavior** changed, how it was tested, and what the hardware checklist gave. It also records new findings. Every Claude session reads this file after CLAUDE.md, and adds its entry before the step is merged. It is also the source for the final report.

New findings get the next free ID after ROADMAP §4 (F37, F38, ...). The "Step" column says where each one should be resolved. When a finding is fixed, write the step and the date in the "Status" column; don't delete the row.

## Findings log (new since ROADMAP §4)

| # | Finding | Where | Severity | Step | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F37 | Console commands are exact string matches: a trailing `\r` (CRLF line ending) makes every command silently do nothing. Prefix commands (`slotN`, `clockMM`) still work. Worked around in the monitor settings (`monitor_eol = LF`), not in the firmware. | `Tests.cpp:87`, `main.cpp:254` | Medium | FW7 (the protocol parser must strip CR) | open |
| F38 | A bare `clock` or `clockxx` parses as minute 0 and **rotates to slot 7** instead of printing an error. | `Tests.cpp:277-290` | Low | FW2 | open |
| F39 | Legacy Pi link: **any line starting with `sample`** runs a full sample; a malformed depth only prints "Error depth" first. | `main.cpp:257-298` | High (legacy) | FW7 (legacy protocol retired) | open |
| F40 | `step_purge()` (`purgeSterivexFunction`, `purgeContainerFunction`) **leaves the O-ring locked** at the purge slot; the next bare `rotateMotor()` then rotates while locked. | `Step_functions.cpp:220-259` | High | FW4 (auto-unlock before rotation) | open |
| F41 | `calibrate_flow` sets no valves before pumping, and its pump loop doesn't poll the pressure cap (only `pump.start()` checks it). | `Tests.cpp:1384-1474` | High | FW4 / FW5 | open |
| F42 | `step_fill_container()` runs the pump at 100 % for up to 11 min (the container switch D27 is gone), without polling the cap. Reached by `fillContainerFunction` and `purgePipesFunction`. | `Step_functions.cpp:126-213` | Medium | FW5 (cap polling); P2 (remove container code) | open |
| F43 | `zero` (`go_to_zero()`) has no timeout and no encoder-failure check: it spins forever if the encoder fails. It also ignores the lock. | `Tests.cpp:1841-1873` | Medium | FW2 | open |
| F44 | `calibrate_pressure2` computes the new offset from `OLD_OFFSET = 0.483`, but the sensor code uses `OffSet = 3.105`, so the printed value is wrong. (The A2 sensor is retired in FW3 anyway.) | `Tests.cpp:744`, `Pressure_sensor.cpp:10` | Low | FW3 | open |
| F45 | `Flow_sensor.h` declares `flow_small = 12` and `flow_big = 13`, the opposite of Settings.h (`FLOW_SMALL_PIN = 13`, `FLOW_BIG_PIN = 12`). Unused, but misleading. | `Flow_sensor.h:11-12` | Low | FW4 (flow sensor work) | open |
| F46 | `scale_angle()`'s loop guard (`loop_nb`) is never incremented: ±inf would loop forever. Not reachable from the encoder path. Kept as is in FW0 (no behavior change). | `src/Core/manifold_geometry.cpp` | Low | FW2 | open |
| F47 | VNH5019 diagnostics are never read: EN/DIAG D5/D30 and current sense A10/A11 (`Motor::stopIfFault()` has no caller). Motor faults and stalls go unseen. | `Motor.cpp:218` | Medium | FW5 | open |
| F49 | `Serial.begin(9600)` is called twice: `C_output.cpp:30`, then again at `main.cpp:202`. The second call resets the UART while the last boot lines are still in the TX buffer, so `system initalized` / `Programm started` and the last "Button ... initiated" lines are lost and a garbage byte appears. Seen on the FW0 smoke test. Cosmetic today, but it hides boot messages that FW6 will rely on (reset cause, self-check). | `main.cpp:202` | Low | FW6 (boot rework) | open |
| F50 | **No pressure sensor is installed** (FW0 bench check, 2026-09-24). The analog sensor on A2 (`pressure2`) was physically removed, yet it still backs the pump cap and every PID loop: `pressure` reads 0.11 bar from the floating pin, **so the cap can never trip**. Nothing answers on the ABP chip select D8 (`pressure1`): `ERROR \| P1: invalid SPI response (bad status bits)`, 0.00 bar. Until FW3 + HW4: no pumping against a closed or clogged outlet, and none unattended. FW3 renames `pressure1` → `p_in` and deletes the A2 code (user-approved). | `main.cpp:116-139`, `Step_functions.cpp`, `Pressure_sensor.cpp` | **Blocking** | FW3 + HW4 | open |
| F51 | **The 3/2 valve V23 was physically removed** (user, 2026-09-24). Its relay on D40 still clicks (`valves` test), and the code still switches `valve_23` in `step_fill_container`, `sample_process`, `demo_sample_process`, `purge_pipes_manifold`, `calibrate_DNA_pump`, `test_valves` and the panel mode V23. Harmless, but dead. Removal is user-approved and planned in FW4 item 11. | `main.cpp:79,136`, several | Low | FW4 | open |
| F52 | `enc_rot` (`getRotationSPI()`) prints a meaningless turn count (16382 = 0x3FFE: the single-turn AMT22 doesn't answer the turns command) and an angle above 360° (637.38°): it scales the 14-bit value by the 12-bit factor without the `>> 2`. Display only; `rotateMotor()` uses `getPositionSPI()`, which is correct. | `Manifold.cpp:449-474` | Low | FW2 | open |
| F48 | F12 correction: `pio run -e uno` fails because of Due-only code (`DAC1`, `A10`, `A11`, `Serial1`, SAM3X registers in `Encoder_atmel.cpp`), **not** because `include/interfaces` is missing (it doesn't exist, but `due` builds with the same flag). | `platformio.ini`, several | Low | P2 (drop `uno` or guard the code) | open |

## FW0: Baseline, test harness, CI, pin map (2026-09-24)

**Branch:** `Quentin-sealingMotor-stepperMotor` · **Base commit:** `d508f41` · **Status:** smoke test passed; waiting for the commit + tag `baseline-v0`.

**Decisions taken with the user (2026-09-24):** delete the A2 analog pressure code and rename `pressure1` → `p_in` in FW3 (not FW0: FW0 must not change behavior); delete the V23 code in FW4. Both are written into the ROADMAP prompts.

**Behavior changes:** none. The firmware diff is the manifold-math extraction plus comments:
- `src/Core/manifold_geometry.{h,cpp}` (new): the slot-angle table, clock labels and `scale_angle`, moved out of `Manifold.cpp` unchanged.
- `src/Hardware/Manifold.cpp`: the four functions now call `core::`. It adds a `static_assert` that `NB_SLOT` matches the geometry.
- `include/Manifold.h`: `MANIFOLD_RAW_POSITIONS = 16` (replaces the literal 16s).
- `include/Settings.h`: comments only (pointers to PINOUT.md).
- `platformio.ini`: the `native` test env, `test_ignore = *` on `due`, and serial-monitor settings (LF line ending, send on ENTER, local echo).
- Size: flash 85,848 → 86,112 B (+264); RAM unchanged at 4,564 B.

**Added:** `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/PINOUT.md`, `docs/COMMANDS.md`, `docs/TESTS_PENDING.md`, this log, `test/test_manifold_geometry/` (15 tests), `test/stubs/`, and `tools/golden/` (regenerates the goldens from `d508f41`).

**Tests:**
- `pio run -e due`: pass.
- `pio test -e native`: 15/15 pass. The goldens (the table, the clock labels in both directions, 1,335 `scale_angle` inputs) are compared bit for bit. Mutation check: breaking the clock rounding or the ±180° boundary makes the tests fail.
- The goldens were computed on the PC (g++), not on the Due. The smoke test step `clocklist` checks the labels on the board.

**Hardware smoke test:** to fill in:

| Check | Pass criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Boot prints `system initalized` then `Programm started` | both lines (or at least: the menu answers) | partial: output stops after `Button B_start initiated` + a garbage byte (F49, pre-existing); the menu answers → pass |
| `clocklist` | 0=30, 1=34, 2=38, 3=41, 4=49, 5=53, 6=56, 7=0, 8=4, 9=8, 10=11, 11=15, 12=19, 13=23, 14=26 | **pass** (2026-09-24) |
| (precondition) O-ring unlocked | found locked after the reboot (F18): unlocked by hand with `linear_actuator` → `e` → `f` ... → `x` | |
| `slot0`, `slot5`, `clock00` (→ slot 7), `slot0` | each < 15 s, no `ERROR`, aligned within ~1° | **pass** (visual) |
| `enc_rot`, `pressure` | print values, no hang | **pass**, with findings: `enc_rot` = turns 16382, angle 637.38 (F52, display bug); `pressure` = P1 SPI error + 0.00 bar, P2 = 0.11 bar from a floating pin: **no pressure sensor installed** (F50) |
| `valves` | each valve clicks twice in 30 s | **pass**: 3 relays heard twice; the V23 valve itself is physically removed (F51) |

**Smoke test verdict: PASS** (2026-09-24). FW0 behaves like `d508f41`; the findings above are pre-existing hardware/code facts, not regressions.

**Environment notes (this laptop):** WinLibs GCC 16.1 installed with winget, for `pio test -e native`. PlatformIO downloads need a CA bundle that includes the Windows root store (TLS inspection); see CLAUDE.md.

**Open questions for later steps:** Does the team still have the 150 psi ABP (for FW3 before the 060 order arrives)? See findings F37–F52.
